# Operation Safe Return

A browser-based first-person hostage-rescue game with a paper-and-ink look. Find the hostage and escape together. Built with TypeScript, Three.js, Preact, and Vite.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local Vite URL and select **Begin mission**. Controls are in the game menu. The character lab is at `/lab.html`.

Zombie mode is at `/?mode=zombies`. Automatic live reload is disabled so source edits do not reset a game that is playing or paused in another tab. Refresh manually when you want to load code changes; a refresh starts a new run.

- `npm run build` — type-check and build for production.
- `npm test` — run all logic checks.

[MIT](LICENSE) covers the source code. Audio has separate terms; Project I.G.I. recordings are not licensed for reuse here. See [sound credits](public/sounds/CREDITS.md).

## Working with coding agents

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains the shared project instructions, structure, and testing guide. The [browser-check workflow](.agent/skills/browser-check/SKILL.md) covers visual verification of the game and character lab.

`.agent/` holds repository workflow notes; automatic discovery depends on the coding tool. `CLAUDE.md` imports the shared instructions for compatibility. Keep machine-local settings out of Git and save generated screenshots, recordings, and test evidence in the ignored `artifacts/` directory.
